## Objectives

Using objects and object constructors to organize code and create a library app

## Screenshot

## Things I learned

- Using methods that can delete rows from tables and return an index row of a table

## Thought process

After filling out the info on the form, when the "Add Book" button is clicked A table will be displayed on the window.
The table will show the the title, author, number of pages, whether the book has been read and a button to delete the book from
the table.

- The table will be displayed when the class is added to it dynamically via JS

- When button is clicked, the new book object is instantiated and added to myLibrary array
