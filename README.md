# Library Project

This is the first project from TOP's fullstack JS curriculum. A library that shows the books read/unread that can be added or removed

## Description

In this project I will attempt to use the knowledge I learned from objects and OOP of JS. The app should be able to add/remove and also show the whether the book has been read or not.
